# RSA Encryption and Decryption

A simple Python implementation of the **RSA algorithm** for generating public and private keys, encrypting messages, and decrypting them back to plaintext.

---

## üìå Features

* Generate **public** and **private RSA keys**.
* Encrypt any plaintext message using the public key.
* Decrypt ciphertext using the private key.
* Simple, beginner-friendly implementation with detailed comments.

## üìú How RSA Works

RSA is an **asymmetric encryption algorithm** based on the mathematical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers.

**Steps Involved:**

1. Choose two large prime numbers `p` and `q`.
2. Compute `n = p * q`.
3. Calculate Euler's totient `œÜ = (p - 1)(q - 1)`.
4. Choose a public exponent `e` such that `gcd(e, œÜ) = 1`.
5. Calculate the private exponent `d` as the modular inverse of `e` modulo `œÜ`.
6. **Public Key** = `(e, n)`
7. **Private Key** = `(d, n)`

**Encryption Formula:**

```math
C = (M^e) mod n
```

**Decryption Formula:**

```math
M = (C^d) mod n
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Run the Python script:

```bash
python src/rsa_encryption.py
```

Example session:

```
Public Key: (313, 32321)
Private Key: (2017, 32321)

Enter the message to encrypt: Hello RSA
Encrypted Message: [311, 1902, 2921, 2921, 4023, 391]
Decrypted Message: Hello RSA
```
